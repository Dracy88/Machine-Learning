# A complete ML project
My personal project of a Data Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales).

The target is try to predict the next future sales of the 1C Company for the next month, starting from a russian dataset that contains the sells of various items for each store from Jan 2013 to Oct 2015.

## Summary
- I had used GBDT with LightGbm since it’s more fast than Xgboost and Sklearn. I also noticed that GBDT are really fast
to implement, with good results and a little hyper parameter tune.
- Libraries: 
- Pandas (to manage the data frames)
- Numpy (to manipulate vectors)
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn (for label encoding and mean square metrics), Pickle (to dump the models and
processed sets).
● Tools: Python, Jupyter notebook and Virtual Env.
